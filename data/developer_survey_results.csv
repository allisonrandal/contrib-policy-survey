I find them an understandable reality, even if annoying, and think it would be great if every project came to see them as a best practice and 2-3 standard agreements became common. That is, we need 'the GPL' of CLAs to emerge so that it can become as frictionless as the GPL did. Apache's CLA is close to this, but people are still confused about it. The OSI, FSF, Linux Fdn, and major distros could lead the way here, but it's unclear they could all agree on messaging around this."

An open source project's most valuable resource is the time that is freely donated to it by contributors, and any distraction of that time on paperwork and overhead essentially redirects that contributor's donated time to the dump."

I do not believe this to be the case, as quite a lot of design effort (including from interested legal policy authors and defenders) has gone into the design of modern open source and free software licenses. Further, contributor license agreements have a ""chilling effect"" on contributions to free software projects, since they are all too often also used in various forms to nefarious ends by companies wishing to leverage community labor in production of ""open core"" software and similar exploitative business models."

A non-profit run as a puppet for a for-profit is the same as the for profit for example. The real issue is what the CLA says and what powers it grants them. Ideally they should not use a CLA at all. Whatever concerns they have should be incorporated into the project's license itself and a CLA not used at all. Secondarily, if a CLA is used it should legally bind the project and entity doing the CLA to keep the software free software at all times (refer to FSF's copyright assignment.) As easy way to do that is not having a CLA at all and simply having a DCO-style thing with everyone keeping their copyright and not granting extra permissions to anyone else that would let them take the software proprietary. If these legal assurances were not presnt I would not agree to a CLA no matter if it's a for-profit or non-profit. This question focuses on the wrong issue.","5","Yes","","Other","See my other answer to CLA - The answer is the same. I have assigned copyright previously - to the FSF because they've been around for 30 years and have shown themselves to good a good copyright steward. Plus, their CAA obligates the FSF to keep the software free so they can't abuse the trust given. So this question, just like the one on the last page, focuses on the wrong issue. It does affect my decision based on what powers are granted, not necessarily by who gets those powers.","5","Yes","3","Other","I am fine contributing to a kernel.org-style DCO because I retain the copyright and no one gets the power to make it proprietary.","No","","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","I declined because their policy specifically allowed my contributions to be able to made proprietary.

For example, I have never declined to sign things, but then again I haven't developed any submitable code for projects I wouldn't sign things for. E.g. I disagree with FSF copyright assignment and the treatment that GPL2->3 are ""continuiations in spirit of the license"" and for example changes to GPL3 drove out Apple contributions to gcc of objc improvements and C. objectives ( see N1451 Blocks proposal), a net loss for gcc I think. Instead they invest in llvm/clang toolchain, which maybe is a more significant impact over they previous gcc efforts. A net win for total # of opensourced code?!"
